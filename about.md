My name is Jamis Buck, and this is my algorithms blog.

Don't be all scared off because I said "algorithms", though. It's
kind of non-traditional.

This is a different world, here. Magic is real, for one thing. Things
get a bit medieval at times. There are some odd anachronisms, too, but
that's okay, because things are sort of ridiculous here, anyway.

Basil Smockwhitener, wizard and gentleman, will be our host in this odd
exploration of algorithms and computer science. He can be a bit clueless
at times, so be gentle. He's doing his best.

And if his manservant, Fabian, can put up with him, surely anyone can.
Right?


I love suggestions!
-------------------

Seriously. If there is a problem you think Basil could shed some light on,
email me and let me know.

I'm [@jamis](http://twitter.com/jamis) on Twitter, [jamis](http://github.com/jamis)

Don't be a stranger!
