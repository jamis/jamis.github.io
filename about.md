title: About Basil & Fabian
---

My name is Jamis Buck, and this is my algorithms blog.

Don't be all scared off because I said "algorithms", though. It's
a bit non-traditional.

This is a different world, here. Magic is real, for one thing. Things
get a bit medieval at times. There are some odd anachronisms, too, but
that's okay, because things are just a bit ridiculous here, anyway.

Basil Smockwhitener, wizard and gentleman, will be your host in this odd
exploration of algorithms and computer science. He can be a bit clueless
at times, so be gentle. He's doing his best.

And if his manservant, Fabian, can put up with him, surely anyone can.
Right?
