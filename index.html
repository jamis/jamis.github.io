        Our heroes have a lot more to experience before they're
        through. Come back weekly to read more of their escapades, each
        lovingly hand-crafted and illustrated by millions of tiny cells,
        miraculously acting in focused unison. Oh, and there's an
        <a href="{{ site.url }}/feed.xml">RSS feed</a>, too,
        if that's your thing.
